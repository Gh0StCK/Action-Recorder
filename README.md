# ActionRecorder (Fork) (Work is still in progress)

**ActionRecorder** is a Blender add-on that allows you to **record**, **edit**, and **replay** sequences of operators as reusable **actions (macros)**.  
It helps automate repetitive workflows by turning complex multi-click operations into **single-button actions**.

This repository is an **unofficial fork** of the original add-on by **InamuraJIN** and **RivinHD**.  
All credits for the concept, design, and core implementation belong to them.  
This fork includes **small functional tweaks**, **minor improvements**, and several **behavior fixes**, while maintaining full compatibility with the original project.
